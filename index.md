Welcome — this is a focused collection of my **scientific writing and editorial work**.
I specialize in **clarity, structure, and precision** for manuscripts, figures, and grants.  
Strengths: developmental & line editing, tightening abstracts/titles, figure-first storytelling, and journal-ready polish.
